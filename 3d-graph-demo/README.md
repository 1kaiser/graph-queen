## ✨ What is Graph Queen?

Graph Queen is an intelligent document visualization tool that converts images and PDFs into interactive knowledge graphs. Simply upload a document, and watch as OCR technology extracts every word, positions them at their exact locations, and overlays them on the original image - creating a powerful visual representation of your content.

### 🎯 Key Highlights

- **📸 Automatic OCR** - Upload images or PDFs and instantly extract all text with bounding boxes
- **🖼️ Image Background** - See your original document as a semi-transparent background
- **🎨 Interactive Graph** - Nodes positioned at exact word locations from the document
- **🔗 Smart Connections** - Manually draw connections or use AI to auto-connect similar words
- **🔍 Zoom & Pan** - Smooth, infinite zoom and pan capabilities with wheel and drag
- **🎤 Voice Input** - Speak to create new nodes (Web Speech API)
- **💾 Export** - Save your graph as JSON with full metadata

## 📸 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Upload Document
Click "📸 Upload Image/PDF" and select any document image or PDF file.

### Step 2: Automatic OCR Processing
Graph Queen automatically:
- 🔍 Extracts all text using Tesseract.js OCR
- 📦 Gets word-level bounding boxes
- 🎯 Creates nodes at exact word positions
- 🖼️ Displays original image as background

### Step 3: Interact with Your Graph
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Click and drag on canvas
- **Select**: Click any node to select it (turns orange)
- **Edit**: Double-click a node to edit its label
- **Delete**: Select nodes and press Delete/Backspace

### Step 4: Create Connections
**Manual Mode:**
1. Click "🔗 Connect Mode" (turns ON)
2. Drag from one node to another to draw a connection
3. Click "🔗 Connect Mode" again to turn OFF

**Auto-Connect Mode:**
1. Click "🤖 Auto-Connect Similar"
2. Enter similarity threshold (0-100%)
3. Graph Queen automatically connects similar words using:
   - Levenshtein distance
   - Cosine similarity (character bigrams)

### Step 5: Export Your Work
Click "💾 Export Graph" to download JSON with:
- All nodes with labels and positions
- All edges with connections
- OCR metadata and confidence scores
- Graph statistics (avg degree, density)

- **Accuracy**: Word-level bounding boxes with confidence scores
- **Languages**: English (extendable to 100+ languages)

### Graph Visualization

#### 🎯 Node Features
- **Positioning**: Nodes placed at exact word locations from OCR
- **Labels**: Permanent labels above each node
- **Colors**:
  - Default: Indigo (#6366F1)
  - Selected: Amber (#F59E0B)
  - Hovered: Purple (#8B5CF6)
- **Interactions**:
  - Click to select
  - Double-click to edit label
  - Hover to see connections
  - Drag to reposition (position is fixed after drag)

#### 🔗 Edge Features
- **Creation**: Manual drag-to-connect or auto-connect

### Smart Features

#### 🤖 AI-Powered Auto-Connect
Connects similar words automatically using dual similarity metrics:

**Levenshtein Distance:**
- Calculates character-level edit distance
- Best for catching typos and variations
- Example: "color" and "colour" = 83% similar

**Cosine Similarity (Character Bigrams):**
- Analyzes character pair frequencies
- Best for detecting semantic similarity
- Example: "graph" and "graphics" = 75% similar

**Combined Score:**
- Takes average of both metrics
- Configurable threshold (default 60%)
- Creates edges only when threshold is exceeded

#### 🎤 Voice Input
- **Activation**: Click microphone button 🎤
- **Recording**: Button turns red 🔴
- **Result**: Transcribed text added to text box
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (Web Speech API)

- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core features work without advanced APIs
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Accessible** - Full keyboard navigation support

### Performance
- **WebAssembly** - OCR processing runs at near-native speed
- **Web Workers** - OCR runs off main thread (when supported)
- **Canvas Rendering** - Efficient SVG-based visualization
- **Lazy Loading** - Heavy libraries loaded on demand
