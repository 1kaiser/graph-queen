## ✨ What is Graph Queen?

Graph Queen is an intelligent document visualization tool that converts images and PDFs into interactive knowledge graphs. Simply upload a document, and watch as OCR technology extracts every word, positions them at their exact locations, and overlays them on the original image - creating a powerful visual representation of your content.

### 🎯 Key Features

- 📸 **Automatic OCR** - Upload images or PDFs and instantly extract all text
- 🎨 **Interactive Graph** - Nodes positioned at exact word locations
- 🔗 **Smart Connections** - Manually draw or use AI to auto-connect similar words
- 🔍 **Zoom & Pan** - Smooth, infinite zoom and pan capabilities
- 💾 **Export** - Save your graph as JSON with full metadata
